<h2>London Maths Outreach course: Effective Methods in Algebra</h2>
<h4><em>17:00 PM to 19:00 PM on Wednesdays, 19 March, 26 March, 2 April, 2025.</em></h4>
<b>Instructor:</b> Abhiram Natarajan (<tt>abhiram.natarajan[light <b>at</b> the end of the tunnel]warwick.ac.uk</tt>)<br>
<br>
This course is run as part of the  
            <a href="https://www.londonmathsoutreach.org/home">London Maths Outreach</a> organised in collaboration with students in London at UCL, London School of Geometry and Number Theory, and Imperial College.

<b> Course Description: </b> 'Algebra' commonly refers to Elementary Algebra, which involves arithmetic with numerical values and variables, or Abstract Algebra, which is algebra in full generality applicable to nearly any mathematical domain. To say that algebra is fundamental to mathematics would be an understatement — it is nearly impossible to separate algebra from any mathematical activity. In this course, we will explore algorithmic methods for solving problems in both linear and nonlinear algebra. We will examine how algorithms for fundamental tasks, such as solving systems of linear equations/polynomials, connect to diverse areas like geometry, topology, computational complexity, combinatorics, and probability. Students can expect to have a fun ride as they witness how simple algebraic procedures give rise to deep and unexpected connections across seemingly unrelated fields of mathematics.
<p>
<!--
<p> The broad plan would be to cover the following.
<ul>
<li>Solving system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination and Geometric Interpretation.
<li>Computation of Determinant, Complexity of Computing the Permanent.
<li>Grobner Basis: Definition of Ideal, Computation of S-polynomials, Buchberger's Algorithm.
<li>Applications of Grobner Bases: Solvability of Polynomial Systems (e.g. Sudoku), Ideal Membership, Elimination, Syzygies, de Rham Cohomology, etc.
<li>Randomized Algorithm to Check Equality of Polynomials, Segue to Polynomial Identity Testing.
</ul>-->

<b> Prerequisites: </b> I will try to make the course as self-contained as possible. Students of all background are welcome. Basic high-school level mathematical maturity will be assumed.

<p> Before each lecture, I will mention (well in advance) what you need to be familiar with to follow the lecture. I will also post resources which will help you gain familiarity. Not only that, I am most happy to engage with you outside class to discuss those concepts and help you. During the actual class, I <i>might</i> give brief introductions to those concepts, but can make no promise about it. It would be best if you are prepared that I will assume familiarity with those concepts.
