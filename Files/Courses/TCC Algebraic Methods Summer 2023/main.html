<b> Syllabus: </b> Just like zeros of polynomials to algebraic geometry, computational complexity theory (CCT) has its roots in people trying to classify computational problems according to their resource usage. Over the past 50+ years, it has matured into a profound quest about the limits of what sorts of mathematical questions finite procedures can answer. Complexity theorist Scott Aaronson calls CCT <i>quantitative epistemology</i>. In addition to the many spectacular and revealing insights into the nature of the universe, CCT has provided the P vs NP question to mathematics, which is one of the Clay Millenium problems.

<p>A first course in CCT usually defines and explores many discrete objects, and the basic theorems largely use combinatorial reasoning. Over the years, there has been a very definitive influx of algebraic thinking (algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, representation theory, etc.) into CCT. This course shall attempt to go over some of the main avenues for <i>algebraic thought</i> in CCT. The broad plan would be to cover the following:
<ul>
<li>Complexity of matrix multiplication (involves tensors, tensor rank, etc.)
<li>Permanent vs Determinant - classical work about the determinantal complexity of the permanent, geometric complexity theory, etc. (involves representation theory, algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, etc.)
<li>Topological notions in algebraic computation/decision trees, etc. (involves homology, Betti numbers, etc.)
<li>Miscellaneous topics - Ulrich complexity, Freedman's work in Knot theory resting on complexity conjectures, etc. If there is more time, then it might be possible to cover some interactions between category/sheaf theory and CCT as well.
</ul>

<b> Prerequisites: </b> I will try to make the course as self-contained as possible. Students of all background are welcome. My goals are two-fold: 

<p>1) I want (any potential) computer science students to be introduced to the many powerful abstract algebraic tools that are permeating CCT,
<p>2) I want pure math students to be exposed to the many profound and fiendishly difficult problems in CCT where algebraic methods can provide insights. To this end, I'd be grateful if interested people could send me emails in advance informing me of their background, so I can gauge how much background material I need to prepare.

<p> Before each lecture, I will mention (well in advance) what you need to be familiar with to follow the lecture. I will also post resources which will help you gain familiarity. Not only that, I am most happy to engage with you outside class to discuss those concepts and help you. During the actual class, I <i>might</i> give brief introductions to those concepts, but can make no promise about it. It would be best if you are prepared that I will assume familiarity with those concepts.

<b> Expectations: </b> Active class participation is most encouraged. After each class, you will also be required to send a short email to me recording <i>three concepts</i> that stood out to you. This is based upon <a href="https://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/threethings.html">Ravi Vakil's note</a> about how even someone who finds the contents of a talk completely alien can end up improving their mathematical knowledge after all. 

<p>The idea is that during the lecture, you record three things (e.g definitions, theorems, themes, examples, questions) that stood out to you. They should be things you have not encountered previously (if none exist, just choose your most favourite things). If unknown to you, should look up these things in whatever sources you find, read about them, and try to internalize them to some extent. Your email should name the three things, and also comment on those things. Your comments should reflect your personal understanding/interpretation. Don't just state definitions.

<p> I don't want to put a mandate such as a minimum number of words per concept. I will trust that you will be conscientious and do the exercise seriously, and comment on the concepts meaningfully.

<b> Textbooks: </b> There will be no singular textbook/reference for this class. I plan on using a myriad of sources. Having said that, the material presented will have overlap with the contents of the following:
  <ul> 
    <li> <a href="https://www.math.tamu.edu/~jml/simonsclass.pdf">Geometry and Complexity Theory by Landsberg</a>
	<li> <a href="https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~u2270030/teaching_sb/summer17/introtogct/gct.pdf">Introduction to Geometric Complexity Theory by Blaser and Ikenmeyer</a>
